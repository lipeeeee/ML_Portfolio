# Machine Learning Portfolio/Notebook
</div>
This repository contains my personal notes, my journey to learning machine learning and a collection of machine learning projects that I have worked on as part of it. The repository is organized into notes and projects. Each project is organized into its own folder and includes its own README.md file with a resume of the project and its findings.
<p>

I started this repository to <b>document</b> my progress and to <b>showcase</b> the skills I have learned.
